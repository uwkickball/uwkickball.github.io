				<h2>PLAYER OF THE WEEK</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>WEEK 1: <b>Mallory Monohan: "Pitching a complete game, topped off by a strikeout in the 7th inning, Mallory also kicked a flawless 1.000 in the lead off position on offense. Simply mowing down batters from the mound wasn't enough for Mallory as she also mowed through fielders with base running chops to keep her team in the lead." - Hal Holmes & Bob Lamm</b></li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>WEEK 2: <b>Mallory Monahan: "Turned in a second consecutive game of stellar pitching with no runs scored by the Busch Leaguers in 4 of the 7 innings played. She also continued her outstanding on-base streak. However, what really stood out this week was her steady leadership and astute coaching at first base, which led to the sublime base-running exhibited by her team." - Jon Tsui
					Zak Wescoe: "In addition to contributing to the offensive fireworks that were on display, he was also a mustachioed menace in short-center field, where many of the Busch Leaguers' hopes and dreams died in his outstretched arms." - Jon Tsui</b></li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>WEEK 3: <b>Wilbert Copeland: "Squirtles in the Outfield had some of the best plays, between Alex and Gizzy's kicks, and great catches by many players.

However, lesser stars can only shine so bright when in the presence of a super-nova and all mortal acts carried out on Friday paled in comparison to Wilbert and The One Catch. As our Player of the Game, none of us will ever know what went through Wilbert's mind as he spun and contorted with grace to secure The One Catch, but through historical records, this is what I've determined.

Three flips for the Busch-Leaguers under the skies,
Seven for the Pitcher on her base of stone,
Nine for the Squirtles doomed to die,
One for Captain Bobbay on his dark throne
In the Land of Kickball where the Wilbert lies.
One Catch to rule them out, One Catch to end them,
Three flips to bring it in and by Will's arms defend them
In the Land of Kickball where the Wilbert lies." -Dandalf the Grey</b></li>
