				<h2>PLAYER OF THE WEEK</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>WEEK 1: <b>Wilbert Copeland: "Game-changing triple in the 5th inning. Brilliant closer performance, punctuated with the final 2 web-gem-worthy outs."</b></li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>WEEK 2: <b>Ty Youngblood: "Golden glove performance, a one-man highlight reel in the field, with a handful of RBIs and heads up baserunning that carried his team to victory."</b></li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>WEEK 3: <b>Jean-Paul Toussaint: "Kicked an early home run, scored a few runs and rbis late, and impressively grabbed 3rd base while over-sliding to maintain contact. Everything a good ringer should do."</b></li>

				<h2>POSTSEASON</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>PLAYOFF: July 31, 6:00pm: <a href="team2.html">OMG, Becky Look At Her Bunt</a> def. <a href="team1.html">kickBall Don't Lie or (Guns & Buns in the Sun)</a>, 12-6<br/>
					Player of the Week: <b>Dan Sedlacek:
					<li>"Both looking and playing the part, Dan was a blinding flash of neon-tighted lightning streaking around the bases and through the outfield, taking up enough field to easily make up for OMG Becky's 2-man deficit. Dan consistently sacrificed his body, and his pristine tights, laying out balls left and right, gobbling them up like the yellow hungry hungry hippo.</li>
					<li>When the game got tight, Big D came up huge. Knotted at 4-3 in the bottom of the 4th, he knocked one deep to advance his runners, eventually leading to a 3-score inning. He protected that lead in the next inning with a sensational diving catch that left hopeful Buns & Guns runners stranded on base. Adding another RBI in the bottom of the 6th, Dan helped extend the lead and cement the victory. Not letting up despite the 12-6 lead, Dan stamped OMG Becky's ticket to the Championship with two more great catches for the final outs of the game."</b></li>
